# svg-logo-generator
Eighth bootcamp challenge, using what we have learned in class, 
with help from instructors, classmates, and outside research(YouTube tutorials, stack overflow, etc.) 
to make an automatic svg logo generator. It must run in the command line, accept user input, and displays all
user input in a new logo.svg file. When the file is displayed in your browser it will show the logo using the 
matching criteria from the input.
